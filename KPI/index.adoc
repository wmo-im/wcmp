= WMO Core Metadata Profile Key Performance Indicators

== Overview
This document is intended to define the Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) for the WMO Core Metadata Profile.  KPIs provide measurable, value
added quality
assessment rules over and above syntactic and schematic rulesets put forth by
WCMP and ISO 19115:2003/19139:2007.

The core driver of WCMP KPIs is continuous improvement and useability of
WMO discovery metadata as part of the https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/wmo-information-system-wis[WMO Information System (WIS)].

== Overview
This document is intended to define the Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) for the WMO Core Metadata Profile (WCMP).  KPIs provide measurable,
value added quality assessment rules over and above syntactic and schematic

The core driver of WCMP KPIs is continuous improvement and useability of
WMO discovery metadata as part of the https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/wmo-information-system-wis[WMO Information System (WIS)].

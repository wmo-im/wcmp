== E. Temporal information

Metadata records should contain the following temporal information:

. Temporal extent: This element describes the period of time that the available product covers.
. Data Update frequency: The temporal frequency at which the data is updated (ie, every x hours, days, ...).

=== E.1 Temporal Extent

==== E.1.1 To which WCMP element(s) does it apply?

To the TemporalElement element in gmd:identification info

/gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo/*/ gmd:extent/*/gmd:temporalElement/*/gmd:extent/

Example:
....
<gmd:temporalElement>
   <gmd:EX_TemporalExtent id="boundingTemporalExtent">
     <gmd:extent>
       <gml:TimePeriod gml:id="boundingTemporalExtentPeriod">
       <gml:beginPosition>2005-10-01</gml:beginPosition>
       <gml:endPosition>2014-10-20</gml:endPosition>
       </gml:TimePeriod>
     </gmd:extent>
   </gmd:EX_TemporalExtent>
</gmd:temporalElement>
....

==== E.1.2 What is being measured?

The presence of such element in the WCMP evaluated record.

==== E.1.3 Why should we measure it?

This is a crucial information for qualifying the product described by a metadata record but it is optional in the WCMP 1.3 standard.

==== E.1.4 How is the measurement executed?

By detecting the presence of such element as a begin end date (with a now for the endPosition for on going datasets) construct or begin, end date and duration for describing the period of retention of the datasets by the service.

See p 17 of the WMO Core Profile Metadata Guidance.

==== E.1.5 What is (are) considered valid results?
The presence of such element as a begin end date (with a now for the endPosition for on going datasets) construct or begin, end date and duration for describing the period of retention of the datasets by the service.

==== E.1.6 Guidance to score well on this assessment
Always add the temporal extent information

=== E.2 Data Update Frequency

==== E.2.1 To which WCMP element(s) does it apply?

The UpdateFrequency element in the WCMP 1.3

nanceAndUpdateFrequency

Example:
....
<gmd:resourceMaintenance>
  <gmd:MD_MaintenanceInformation>
    <gmd:maintenanceAndUpdateFrequency>
     <gmd:MD_MaintenanceFrequencyCode codeListValue="irregular"

==== E.2.2 What is being measured?

The presence of such element in the WCMP evaluated record.

==== E.2.3 Why should we measure it?

This is an important information which indicates how often the product is updated.

==== E.2.4 How is the measurement executed?

By detecting the presence of such element with a period, and a maintenance note.

See p 37 of the WMO Core Profile Metadata Guidance.

==== E.2.5 What is (are) considered valid results?
The presence of such element as

==== E.3 Bulletin metadata availability

A Bulletin should contain a temporal extent with begin end and a period for indicating how long the data is kept on the cache (24 hr).
It should also probably be repeated in the abstract.

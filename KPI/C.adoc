== C. Good quality abstract

=== WCMP element(s)

`/gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo//gmd:abstract`

=== What is being measured

Programmatic measurements:

* Length of abstract is at least 3 sentences
* Spelling and grammar are correct

=== Rationale for measurement

To faciliate ease of understanding and discovery. 

Abstract is a key element of metadata information displayed as part of search
results. Fulsome and meaningful abstract information allows for users to both
understand and properly evaluate a metadata record and its respective resource
in support of data access, visualization and exploitation.

=== Guidance to score well on this assessment

==== WCMP 1.3 Part 1 Guidance

The abstract should provide a clear and concise statement that enables the
reader to understand the content of the dataset. For guidance when completing
the abstract, consider the following recommendations:

. State what the 'things' are that are recorded
. State the key aspects recorded about these things
. State what form the data takes
. State any other limiting information, such as time period of validity of the
  data
. Add purpose of data resource where relevant (e.g. for survey data)
. Aim to be understood by non-experts
. Do not include general background information
. Avoid jargon and unexplained abbreviations

==== Relevant NOAA Recommendations

. A metadata record abstract not a scientific abstract
. Limit information in the abstract to the specific resource that is being
  described
. Describe the contents of the resource and the key aspects and/or attributes
  that are represented
. Briefly explain what is unique about this resource and, if appropriate how
  it differs from similar resources
. Avoid citing external sources to this resource
. Acronyms do not need to be spelled out if they are for commonly used terms
  which are understood by the general public. Once an uncommon acronym is
  spelled out within the Abstract it can be used without explanation
. Do not include html, csv, tables or extra spaces to control display of text.
  Use simple paragraph(s) only
. Do not copy text from a journal article verbatim. This can lead to copyright
  violation concerns. Additionally, abstracts for journal articles are not
  intended to describe the provided resource and do not meet the metadata
  requirements. Related papers can be referenced from and/or tied to the
  metadata. See EDM Wiki about `gmd:MD_AggregateInformation` section for more
  information on citing journals
. Avoid using future verb tense when possible. Write using present or past
  tenses

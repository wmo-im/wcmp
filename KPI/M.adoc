== M. Codelists validation

=== WCMP element(s)

WCMP elements will vary depending on whether they are:

* ISO Codelists (`gmxCodelists.xml`)
* WMO Codelists / ISO extensions (`WMOCodeLists.xml`)

Authoritative codelists are defined at the following locations:

* ISO: https://schemas.isotc211.org/schemas/19139/resources/gmxCodelists.xml
* WMO: https://wis.wmo.int/2012/codelists/WMOCodeLists.xml

=== What is being measured

* Presence of valid terms from the referred codelist element.

=== Rationale for measurement

WCMP records can reference codelists from a number of locations
(e.g. online copies of the authoritative sources).

To ensure that the terms themselves are always consistent with the official sources,
this KPI will validate that the terms referred to in WCMP records are consistent with
the authoritative codelists referred in this KPI.

In many cases terms are included but are not identifical to the official definitions
on the codelists (e.g. spelling mistakes, case sensitivity errors, etc.).

Software applications may look for exact matches to codelists and handle metadata
incorrectly if not properly referenced.

.Codelists validation implementation rules
|===
|Rule |Score

|codelist referred terms are checked against authoritative sources with an exact match
|1

|===

Total possible score: 1 per valid codelist value (100%). To assess how many valid
codelist values are defined and provide a total percentage based on the total
number of codelist values.


=== Guidance to score well on this assessment

Ensure that codelists referenced terms are well defined across the whole
record and from authoritative sources.

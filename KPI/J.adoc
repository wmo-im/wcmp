== J. Broken links

Detection of broken links contributing to the overall quality score.

=== J.1 To which WCMP element(s) does it apply?

All potential linked information (URLs).
Links are generally present in <gmd:onlineResource>, <gmd:graphicOverview>, 

....
<gmd:graphicOverview>
        <gmd:MD_BrowseGraphic>
          <gmd:fileName>
            <gco:CharacterString>https://navigator.eumetsat.int/preview/0deg-snow.jpg</gco:CharacterString>
          </gmd:fileName>
        </gmd:MD_BrowseGraphic>
</gmd:graphicOverview>
....

....
<gmd:CI_OnlineResource>
   <gmd:linkage>
      <gmd:URL>https://eumetview.eumetsat.int/mapviewer/?product=EO:EUM:DAT:MSG:SNOW</gmd:URL>
   </gmd:linkage>
</gmd:CI_OnlineResource>
....

=== J.2 What is being measured?

The number of broken links present in each individual metadata record is being measured

=== J.3 Why should we measure it?

Broken links damage the user experience and gives the impression to users that the site is not maintained (88% of the online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience). In addition broken links affects search engine rankings as having too often or too many broken links affects the reputation of your website towards Search Engines.

=== J.4 How is the measurement executed?

Like in *I* graphic overview a program can regularly pull all the metadata records and look for broken links.
Example of tool could be used and integrated in the GISC quality checking:

- https://github.com/bartdag/pylinkvalidator[pylinkvalidator]: Python package that can be used to check on broken links

Another could be to implement over the GISC catalogues and use a sitemap.xml.

=== J.5 What is (are) considered valid results?

A valid result is a link that can be reached (ends-up with an HTTP 202 or a redirect and a 202).

=== J.6 Guidance to score well on this assessment

Insure that all the included links are always fresh and accessible.

== B. Good quality title

=== To which WCMP element(s) does it apply?

/gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo//gmd:citation//gmd:title

=== What is being measured?
* field is not empty 
* length is not too short or too long. (e.g. at least more than 3 characters and less than 150)
* words are following Title case 
* title is following WCMP guidance 

=== Why should we measure it?
Title is the first reference to a resource displayed and is helps with initial identification. 
If it's not available, too short, or too long then it makes it difficult for users understand the resource. 

=== How is the measurement executed?
Programmatically
Manually

=== What is (are) considered valid results?
Title field is populate, a proper length, and words are title case. 

=== Guidance to score well on this assessment
Titles should be consistent and contain meaningful and useful (from
search/discovery perspective) content.

It is difficult to create some automated software assessing the good
quality of the title. May some elements can be verified (avoid acronyms,
….) but the general concensusconsensus is that a guidance should be
developed for WCMP records.

The Task Team recommends to implement the following Style Guidelines derived from the NOAA guidance:

A good archival title summarizes *what, where and when* data were collected so that a data consumer can read the title and make an informed decision about learning more about the data.

* Capitalize all major words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives,
adverbs, and some conjunctions).
* Avoid using acronyms unless defined in the abstract, especially for
projects or organizations. Exception applies to _NOAA_ as our audience
is familiar with our acronym.
* If you include an acronym, spell out the meaning of the acronym then
put the acronym in parentheses after the meaning. Do not assume that
everyone reading the title will know or understand all acronyms or
jargon. Some common acronyms may be widely understood within a specific
domain.
* Always, spell out the title acronym at least once in the abstract
text.

=== WIS Guidance to be referenced here:

link:http://wis.wmo.int/file=3291[WCMP Guidance]

The Product Title and the Product Abstract are the two most relevant elements in the WCMP metadata
record, in the context of the WIS Product catalogues, as those two elements are presented to the users in
the search results and product description page. They therefore need to focus on highlighting the
product's key characteristics, to assist users searching for relevant products.
The title should be as specific about the product as is possible. If the product only contains one parameter,
for instance, this can be stated in the title; however, if the product contains many parameters, then a more general term should be used in the title, and the parameters stated elsewhere in the metadata
record (the abstract and/or the keywords). For a satellite product offering one main data parameter, the
title will typically define which parameter is contained in the product, and from which instrument or
instrument type it originates. For instance “AMSR-2 Sea Surface Temperature” or “SLSTR L1B radiances
and brightness temperatures”. 

Below is an example:
....
<gmd:identificationInfo>
 <gmd:MD_DataIdentification>
 <gmd:citation>
 <gmd:CI_Citation>
 <gmd:title>
 <gco:CharacterString>AMSR-2 Sea Surface Temperature</gco:CharacterString>
 </gmd:title>
 <gmd:alternateTitle>
 <gco:CharacterString>
 AMSR-2 Sea Surface Temperature SST
 </gco:CharacterString>
 </gmd:alternateTitle>
 . . . . . .
 </gmd:CI_Citation>
</gmd:citation>
 . . .. .
 </gmd:MD_DataIdentification>
</gmd:identificationInfo>
....

==== Title for GTS bulletins

The title for a GTS bulletin should also aim to be specific about the product, describing, as much as
possible, the type of observation, and including the bulletin code or identifier, and original distributor (e.g.
"from XXX").
For instance:
....
<gmd:identificationInfo>
 <gmd:MD_DataIdentification>
 <gmd:citation>
 <gmd:CI_Citation>
 <gmd:title>
 <gco:CharacterString>Sea level observations data [ SZPS01 ] for the South Pacific area</gco:CharacterString>
 </gmd:title>
....

=== Enforcing some of the defined guidance rules

Detect all template generated titles like IEDX02 BUFR bulletin available from EUMP (EUMETSAT - DARMSTADT).
A script can be created to detect that kind of information and it could be regularly generated.

== WMO Core Metadata Profile - Validation Tools

Metadata publishers are required to ensure that created metadata records conform to relevant technical specifications. For example, XML documents need to be well-formed, validated against the schema, and compliant with other requirements imposed by the specifications. 

A set of ISO and WCMP validation tools can be used to ensure that a created WCMP record is correctly formatted (syntactically and semantically) and can be ingested by a GISC. 

In most cases, a metadata author will validate a metadata record using a validation tool. That tool may be either a web service or locally installed software. Usually, metadata records to be validated may be stored either locally or at a URL accessible to the validation tool.

Online validation services can automatically evaluate the content of the metadata in terms of completeness, accuracy and conformance. Some validation tools, such as the one developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/docucomp/recordServices) may give a score based on different aspects, including content and quality of metadata.

It is recommended to test the metadata with one of the available tools. It is also always possible to seek assistance from your principal GISC. 

Below is a list of web services and tools used to validate WCMP 1.3 and ISO 19115/19139 metadata records.

=== WCMP 1.3 validation services and tools:

. NOAA's WMO validation service: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/docucomp/validationServicesWmo;
GeoNetwork-ANZMEST, with WCMP validation tool: https://sourceforge.net/projects/anzmest/files/bom-releases/.  This directory contains the Australian Bureau of Meteorology releases of ANZMEST 2.10.x (based on GeoNetwork), which include the WCMP 1.3 editing and validation tool.  For instructions on running the software and validation tool, see the WIS Wiki page on validation tools below;

=== ISO 19115/19139 validation services and tools:
. NOAA ISO validation page: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/docucomp/recordServices;
. GeoNetwork-ANZMEST â€“ BOM branch: https://sourceforge.net/projects/anzmest/files/bom-releases/ (includes 19115:2006, 19115:INSPIRE).

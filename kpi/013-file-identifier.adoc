== KPI-013: File identifier

=== WCMP element(s)

* `//gmd:fileIdentifier/gco:CharacterString/`

=== What is being measured

Accordance of the structure of the metadata record identification with the recommendation defined in chapter 8.1.2 of the WMO pub 1060. 

=== Rationale for measurement

The value of the fileIdentifier element, i.e. identifier of the metadata record, shall be unique. Achieving global uniqueness in a distributed environment is not trivial, but the structure recommended in the Manual on WIS significantly simplifies management of the identifiers and reduces chance of conflicts/duplicates.

=== Rules for implementation

The WMO Core Metadata Profile recommends the use of a URI for gmd:fileIdentifier attributes. The URI should be structured as follows:

* Fixed string “urn:x-wmo:md:”;

* Citation authority based on the Internet domain name of the data-provider organization,
e.g. “int.wmo.wis”, “gov.noaa”, “edu.ucar.ncar”, “cn.gov.cma” or “uk.gov.metoffice”;

* Double separator colons: “::”;

* Unique identifier (in scope of the citation authority)

*Total possible score: 1 (100%)*

=== Guidance to score well on this assessment

Use metadata record identification (fileIdentifier) in the form of URI.
